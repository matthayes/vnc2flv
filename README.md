# vnc2flv

Desktop Screen Recorder for UNIX, Linux, Windows or Mac.

This is an updated version of [vnc2flx](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/vnc2flv/index.html) that works with
Python 3.  This will not work with Python 2.

To use it, clone the repo and then run:

```
make install
```

`flvrec.py` is the main recording program.  Once installed you can run `flvrec.py --help` to see the available options.

See the [documentation](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/vnc2flv/index.html) for further details.
